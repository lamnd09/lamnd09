                            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 32%;"> Taking care of the elderly population is of crucial significance during a pandemic due to (1) higher mortality rate and (2) longer times for which they are affected by lockdown; that is, they may have the most restricted movement.
                                Caregivers need to help seniors not only in household tasks but also buying groceries, shop for supplies or transport them to another place. All this must be done by people that, with a high likelihood, are negative for
                                the virus. The proposed TRUEDIP system is expected to help via a mobile APP and a webpage to find the best match between certified caregivers and seniors. The proposed solution – and our main innovation – is to build such
                                a platform based on the blockchain technology, for increased security and privacy.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 32%;"> The data collected from Internet of Things (IoT) devices on various emissions or pollution, can have a significant economic value for the stakeholders. This makes it prone to abuse or tampering and brings forward the need to
                                integrate IoT with a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to collect, store, and protect the IoT data. However, DLT brings an additional overhead to the frugal IoT connectivity and symmetrizes the IoT traffic, thus changing
                                the usual assumption that IoT is uplink-oriented. We have implemented a platform that integrates DLTs with a monitoring system based on narrowband IoT (NB-IoT). We evaluate the performance and discuss the tradeoffs in two
                                use cases: data authorization and real-time monitoring.

                            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 32%;"> To address scalability problem of Blockchain, we present a lightweight distributed ledger scheme to integrate PoW blockchain into IoT. In our scheme, we classify transactions into two types: 1) global transactions, which must
                                be processed by global blockchain nodes and 2) local transactions, which can be processed locally by entities called witnesses. Performance evaluation demonstrates that our proposed scheme improves the scalability of integrated
                                blockchain and IoT monitoring systems by processing a fraction of the transactions, inversely proportional to the number of witnesses, locally. Hence, reducing the number of global transactions. </p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 32%;"> Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) are seen as the most promising enabler of decentralized trust, but they still lack technological maturity and their successful adoption depends on the understanding of the fundamental
                                design trade-offs and their reflection in the actual technical design. This work focuses on the challenges and potential solutions for an effective integration of DLTs in the context of Internet-of-Things (IoT). We first
                                introduce the landscape of IoT applications and discuss the limitations and opportunities offered by DLTs. Then, we review the technical challenges encountered in the integration of resource-constrained devices with distributed
                                trust networks. We describe the common traits of lightweight synchronization protocols, and propose a novel classification, rooted in the IoT perspective. We identify the need of receiving ledger information at the endpoint
                                devices, implying a two-way data exchange that contrasts with the conventional uplink-oriented communication technologies intended for IoT systems.
